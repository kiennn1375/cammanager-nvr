# CamManager – Local PC-based NVR for IP Cameras
> Turn your Windows PC into a scalable, local NVR — no cloud, no vendor lock-in.

CamManager is a Windows-based NVR (Network Video Recorder) software that turns a standard PC into a fully local video recording system for IP cameras.

Instead of relying on proprietary hardware NVRs with fixed storage limits and vendor lock-in, CamManager records video streams directly to local disks on your PC or server. Storage can scale freely by adding more drives, and your video data always stays under your control.

CamManager works with RTSP-compatible cameras from multiple manufacturers and does not require any cloud service or external account.
