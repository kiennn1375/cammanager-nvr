# CamManager

CamManager is a Windows-based NVR (Network Video Recorder) software that turns a standard PC into a local video recording system for IP cameras.

Unlike hardware NVRs, CamManager records directly to local disks, allowing storage to scale freely by adding more drives. It works with RTSP-compatible cameras from multiple brands and does not require any cloud service.

## Key Features
- PC-based NVR (no dedicated hardware required)
- Records IP cameras directly to local storage
- Unlimited storage (limited only by disk capacity)
- Supports RTSP cameras from multiple vendors
- Fully local operation (no cloud dependency)
- Designed for 24/7 continuous recording

## Use Cases
- Replace hardware NVRs with a PC-based solution
- Mixed-brand IP camera setups
- Users who want full control over video data
- Self-hosted and privacy-focused environments
