# CamManager – Local PC-based NVR for IP Cameras
> Turn your Windows PC into a scalable, fully local NVR — no cloud, no vendor lock-in.

CamManager is a Windows-based NVR (Network Video Recorder) software that transforms a standard PC or server into a fully local video recording system for IP cameras.

Instead of relying on proprietary hardware NVRs with fixed storage limits, brand restrictions, and cloud dependencies, CamManager records camera streams directly to local disks. Storage capacity scales freely by adding more drives, and all video data always remains under your control.

CamManager supports RTSP-compatible cameras from multiple manufacturers and operates entirely locally, without requiring any cloud service, subscription, or external account.

## Why CamManager?
Traditional hardware NVRs often come with artificial storage limits, vendor lock-in, and restricted camera compatibility. CamManager removes these limitations by using your existing PC hardware and standard IP camera protocols.

With CamManager, you get full ownership of your data, flexible storage expansion, and freedom to mix cameras from different brands.
